## A way to package a software that can run on any environment

What is Docker vs Kubernetes?
While Docker is a container runtime, Kubernetes is a platform for running and managing containers from many container runtimes and used mainly for scalling containers to infinite workloads.

Can Kubernetes Run Without Docker? 
The answer is both yes and no. Kubernetes, in itself, is not a complete solution. It depends on a container runtime to orchestrate; you can't manage containers without having containers in the first place.
